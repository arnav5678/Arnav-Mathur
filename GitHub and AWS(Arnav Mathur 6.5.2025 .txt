AWS:-short for Amazon Web Services, is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. It offers a wide range of cloud computing services, allowing businesses to build, operate, and manage applications on a secure, reliable, and scalable infrastructure. Essentially, AWS provides a way to access IT resources, like servers, storage, and databases, on demand, instead of having to manage them yourself.

# Zip file :- A ZIP file is a common archive file format used for compressing and archiving one or more files into a single, smaller file. It's like a compressed folder that makes it easier to store, share, and distribute multiple files as a single unit.

#How to create zip file
# example 1
tar.exe -a -c -f out.zip in.txt
# example 2
tar.exe -x -f out.zip

# Tar file :- A TAR file, short for "tape archive," is a file format used to bundle multiple files and directories into a single archive. It's commonly used on UNIX-like systems for archiving and distributing software or updates.
According to ScienceDirect and Library of Congress (.gov), a TAR file is not a compressed file, meaning it doesn't reduce the size of the files contained within. Instead, it simply packages them together. 

#How to create tar file

1)Open a terminal or command prompt: Navigate to the directory where you want to create the tar file.
 
2)Use the tar command: 
-Basic Syntax: tar cvf <archive_name.tar> <files_or_directories_to_archive> 
-c: Creates a new archive. 
-v: Provides verbose output, showing the progress of the archiving process. 
-f: Specifies the name of the output archive file. 
\<files_or_directories_to_archive\>: Specifies the files and/or directories you want to include in the archive . 
Example: tar cvf hw10.tar main.c btree.c btree.h README would create a tar file named hw10.tar containing the specified files. 

Example:- 

1)Creating a tar archive of a directory:

Code :- tar cvf myarchive.tar mydirectory

2)This will create a tar file named myarchive.tar containing all files and subdirectories within mydirectory. 
Creating a tar archive of specific files:

Code :- tar cvf myarchive.tar file1.txt file2.pdf

3)This will create a tar file named myarchive.tar containing the specified files file1.txt and file2.pdf. Compressing the tar file using gzip. 


Code :- tar cvf myarchive.tar.gz mydirectory

# Basic functions are:- 
1) cf :- To create file.

2) tf :- To list content of tar file
 
3) xf :- To extract file from tar.

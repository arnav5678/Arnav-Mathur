Step 1 ---> open the vs code in blank(summer) folder

Step 2 ---> open the terminal and write

Step 3 ---> uv init summer-mcp

Step 4 ---> cd summer-mcp

Step 5 ---> uv venv

Step 6 ---> .venv\Scripts\activate

 what is MCP(Model Context Protocol)?
-->MCP (Model Context Protocol) changes that. 
It gives AI agents a simple, standardized way to plug into tools, data, and services — no hacks, no hand-coding. 
With MCP, AI goes from smart… to actually useful.

what is virtual enviroment in programming?
--->A Python Virtual Environment is an isolated space where you can work on your Python projects, separately from your system-installed Python.
 You can set up your own libraries and dependencies without affecting the system Python. 
 We will use "venv" to create a virtual environment in Python.

 what is API(Application Programming Interface)?
 --->An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software systems to communicate and exchange data.
  Think of it as an intermediary that enables applications to interact with each other, rather than requiring direct, complex interactions. 

In simple words API key ---> Application Programming Interface ----> Mediator(user , server)

What is Groq?
---> Groq is a technology company specializing in high-performance AI inference solutions, particularly known for its GroqChip and Language Processing Unit (LPU).
 Groq's LPU is designed to accelerate the processing of AI workloads, especially those involving large language models (LLMs)

We are using Groq_API key to make this project

GROQ_API_KEY -----> Go to google ---> Search groq api key ---> click on create a new api key

What is .env?
--->A .env file is a simple text file that stores environment variables for an application. 
These variables are often used to configure settings like API keys, database connections, or application settings, which can vary between different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).
 By storing these variables in a separate file, it's easier to manage them and keep sensitive information out of the code itself. 

 Main moto of this application which we are making is:-

 User ----> request LLM information request if not available than go to mcp servers ---> (MCP server and give us Live information)
